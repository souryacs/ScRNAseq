BCR and TCR analysis using MixCR
=================================

The MixCR package (https://github.com/milaboratory/mixcr) is the most convenient and easy to use package for analyzing TCR and BCR data generated from a wide range of protocols.

	- The scripts *MixCR_Script_BCR.sh* and *MixCR_Script_TCR.sh* process the BCR and TCR data, respectively.

	- Here we assume that the input data is generated from BD Rhapsody protocol, and corresponds to human reference genome.

	- For input data from other bio assays or other reference genome, user can check the MixCR manual.

	- In these scripts, user needs to edit the relevant parameters and execute.
