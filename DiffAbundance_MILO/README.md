Differential Abundance analysis using MILO
==========================================

Milo is a tool for analysis of complex single cell datasets generated from replicated multi-condition experiments, which detects changes in composition between conditions. 

While differential abundance (DA) is commonly quantified in discrete cell clusters, Milo uses partally overlapping neighbourhoods of cells on a KNN graph.
